# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
Your Security Is Our Priority

SIEM (pronounced as sim) is a fusion of Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM). It is a security solution that gathers data from different networking devices, analysing it and generates potential alerts for unauthorised illegitimate activity.

## How does SIEM work?
SIEM tools gather event and log data created by host systems and bring that data together on a centralised platform. Host systems include applications, security devices, antivirus filters and firewalls. SIEM tools identify and sort the data into categories such as successful and failed logins, malware activity and other likely malicious activity.

The SIEM software generates security alerts when it identifies potential security issues. Using a set of predefined rules, organisations can set these alerts as a low or high priority.

## Why SIEM is important?
SIEM provides instantaneous monitoring and analysis of events as well as tracking and logging of security data for compliance or auditing purposes. It generates security alerts as soon as it encounters abnormal activity. These cyber-alerts are keeping millions of organisations around the world safe and secure.

## The Capabilities of SIEM
As discussed earlier, SIEM is equipped with the basic log collection and management features, however, it extends the horizon to other set of characteristics as well.

### Advanced Real-Time Threat Recognition
### Forensics & Incident Response
### Regulatory Compliance Auditing
### AI-driven Automation
### Monitoring Users and Applications

## SIEM Transcends Into The Cyber-World
Considering how quickly the cybersecurity landscape changes, organisations need to be able to rely on solutions that can detect and respond to both known and unknown security threats. Using integrated threat intelligence feeds and AI technology, SIEM solutions can successfully mitigate against modern-day security breaches such as:

### 1. Insider Threats
Security vulnerabilities or attacks that originate from individuals with authorised access to company networks and digital assets. These attacks could be the result of compromised credentials.

### 2. Phishing Attacks
Social engineering attacks masquerading as trusted entities, often used to steal user data, login credentials, financial information, or other sensitive business information.

### 3. SQL Injections
Malicious code executed via a compromised webpage or application designed to bypass security measures and add, modify, or delete records in an SQL database.

### 4. DDoS Attacks
A Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack designed to bombard networks and systems with unmanageable levels of traffic, degrading performance of websites and servers until they are unusable.

### 5. Data Exfiltration
Data theft or extrusion is commonly achieved by taking advantage of common or easy-to-crack passwords on network assets, or through the use of an Advanced Persistent Threat, or APT.

## How SIEM is embedding Artificial Intelligence â€” The Next Tech GIANT?
Over the years, SIEM has matured to become more than the log management tools that preceded it. Today, SIEM offers advanced user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) thanks to the power of AI and machine learning. It is a highly efficient data orchestration system for managing ever-evolving threats as well as regulatory compliance and reporting.
